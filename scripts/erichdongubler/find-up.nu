# Finds a filesystem entry in `names` in the CWD or its ancestors.
#
# This is implemented by:
#
# - Starting at the CWD, canonicalizing it,, and checking each
#   ancestor directory until the root of the file system has been
#   checked.
# - Ties are broken by the order of entries in `names`.
#   For example, searching for `['.hg' '.git']` in a directory
#   with both `.hg` and `.git` would return the path to the `.hg`
#   marker.
